# Business Problem: To check whether any significant difference between diameters of any two cutlet units.
# We take 2 sample t test as just one variable under two conditions are assessed.

#Ho: No significant difference in diameters of cutlets produced by two units, mean of sample from unit1 = mean of sample from unit 2
##Default condition with no action required
#Ha: There is a difference between the mean diameters of two samples
##Condition in which action is required
